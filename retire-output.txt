 ↳ jquery 1.7.2
jquery 1.7.2 has known vulnerabilities: severity: medium; summary: Selector interpreted as HTML, CVE: CVE-2012-6708, bug: 11290, githubID: GHSA-2pqj-h3vj-pqgw; http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11290 http://research.insecurelabs.org/jquery/test/ https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2012-6708 severity: medium; summary: Versions of jquery prior to 1.9.0 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. The load method fails to recognize and remove "<script>" HTML tags that contain a whitespace character, i.e: "</script >", which results in the enclosed script logic to be executed. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser.
